# Pattern Recognition Course Assignments (Machine Learning Algorithms Implementations and Details)

HW1: Implemented PCA,LDA and cross valiation using my own code.  

HW2: Implemented Decision tree, Random Forests and Adaboost.  

HW3: Used Support Vector Machine in Scikit-Learn and tunned it.  

HW3-2(file: svm_hard_soft_kernel.m): Implemented SVM (soft margin, hard margin, rbf kernel and poly kernel) using MATLAB and CVX package and compared the effects of hyper parameters and kernels.

#### Datasets:  
Wine dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine/  

Covertype dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/covertype  

MNIST dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data

#### To run my code:

There are readme files in each subdirectory. You can follow the further guidance.

For HW3-2 use matlab (my version is MATLAB 2016b) with CVX (convex optimization package, you can find it here: http://cvxr.com/cvx/). The dataset for this part is random points initialized inside the matlab script, the parameters for random points initialization is well designed.
